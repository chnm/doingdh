Data and Materials for Doing DH Workshops and Summer Institutes

The files and data available in this repository were created and shared as sample data sets and files put together for a series of digital history and digital art history summer institutes 2014-16, developed by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. The digital art history institutes were funded by the Getty Foundation, and the digital history institutes are funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
